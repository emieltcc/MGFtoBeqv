# MGFtoBeqv package

This repository contains the MGFtoBeqv package for Mathematica.

The MGFtoBeqv package facilitates the translation from MGFs in their lattice-sum representation to their modular iterated integral representation.

The functions defined in the MGFtoBeqv package are derived from the paper [1].

## Getting Started

To get started clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/emieltcc/MGFtoBeqv.git mgftobeqv
```

Alternatively, you can download the contents of this repository by clicking on **Code** and then **Download Zip** in the top right corner.

After cloning the repository open and run the Mathematica notebook **User_Manual.nb**. It contains a brief introduction to the MGFtoBeqv package and explains all the functions and symbols that the package provides.

## Usage

The MGFtoBeqv package consist of the package file ***MGFtoBevq.wl***,xxx, and multiple .txt files that store dihedral and trihedral identities, and constants the Laurent polynomials of depth 2 and 3 modular iterated integrals.

To load the package into a Mathematica notebook write:

```
Get["MGFtoBeqv.wl"]
```
